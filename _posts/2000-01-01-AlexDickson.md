**Education:**

M. Sc. Chemistry, University of Chicago (2007)  
Ph. D. Chemistry, University of Chicago (2011)  

Alex worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Michigan from 2011 to 2015 in the group of Charles Brooks, III.
His work focused on modeling rare events in biomolecular systems, such as protein folding pathways, and can be grouped into four main accomplishments:

* Development of a new sampling method, WExplore, and its application to several biomolecular rare events such as the unfolding of the chignolin protein, and large loop motions in HIV-1 TAR RNA
* Development of new tools for the network visualization of protein dynamics, where entire free energy landscapes are visualized in a single 2D plot, without the specification of specific order visualization axes, as in principal component analysis
* Utilization of coarse-grained models in conjuction with enhanced sampling methods to observe and characterize the coupled unfolding and binding of the HdeA homodimer: a periplasmic bacterial protein that helps respond to acid shock
* Modeling higher-order biological reaction networks to study protein chaperone activity in E. coli

In his independent career he and his group are bringing these tools to bear to study the biophysics of ligand binding.
