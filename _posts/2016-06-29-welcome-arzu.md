We are pleased to welcome Arzu Uyar, our lab's first postdoc, joining us all the way from Istanbul, Turkey.
Dr. Uyar received her M.S. and Ph. D. degrees from Bogazici University, and has developed expertize in coarse-grained modeling and elastic network simulations.
We are happy to have her in the lab!
