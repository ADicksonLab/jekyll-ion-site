MSU held the 11th annual [Grandparents' University day](http://www.grandparents.msu.edu), where grandparents and 
their grandchildren can take a variety of courses together.

We were happy to offer a course on protein-protein interaction modeling, where students got to manipulate 3D models of proteins, both on the computer screen with [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/), and 3D printed models in real life!  Students learned about transcription factors, protein chaperones, conformational selection, drug selectivity, and more.  Many thanks to the MSU library for printing help and to Dirk Colbry of CMSE.  Thanks to our inquisitive students as well!  We had a lot of fun, and we're looking forward to next year!
