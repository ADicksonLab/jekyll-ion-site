As part of the annual [MSU Science Festival](http://sciencefestival.msu.edu/), Alex presented a talk aimed at middle-school audiences
"What Happens to Molecules When You Turn Up the Heat?" at Abrams' Planetarium.
Using VMD, and dome-formatted rendering commands, this talk included images and videos that stretched over the dome, giving the audience
the impression they are immersed in the molecular environment!
It was a lot of fun to hear the "oohs" and "aahs" from the 8 to 10 year-old crowd!

Thanks to Michael Feig for providing some great data from his cytosol-scale simulations, to Michaela TerAvest for help with a great supporting video, and to the staff at Abrams' for putting in a lot of work to set up the talk.  Can't wait to do this again!
