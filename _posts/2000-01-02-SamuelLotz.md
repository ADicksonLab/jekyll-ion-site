I am working to develop ligand (un)binding transition state
pharmacophores from WExplore (weighted ensemble) trajectories to
enable kinetics informed drug design. 

My current study system, in collaboration with Dr. King Sing Lee, is
the soluble epoxide hydrolase protein which is a target for treating
diabetic neuropathic pain with drugs in phase I clinical trials as
well as
[unbinding kinetics data](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm500694p).

Previously, I have worked on profiling of intermolecular interactions
for (un)binding trajectory networks of FKBP
([paper](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b04012) and
[poster](https://zenodo.org/record/59837)) and trypsin (in review).

To aid in these analyses I am developing an extensible python library,
[mast](https://github.com/salotz/mast) for profiling large datasets
for arbitrarily defined intermolecular interactions between molecules.
