We report simulations of full ligand exit pathways for
the trypsin-benzamidine system using unbiased dynamics, generated
using the sampling technique WExplore. The averaged
exit flux yields a ligand exit rate of 180 microseconds, which is within an
order of magnitude of the experimental value. We obtain broad
sampling of ligand exit pathways, including three distinct exit
channels, two of which are formed through large, rare motions
of the loop regions in trypsin. We use our broad set of ligand
bound poses to investigate general properties of ligand binding,
and observe a trade-off between the direct stabilizing effect of
ligand-protein interactions, and the indirect destabilizing effect
that the ligand induces in the protein-protein interactions. Significantly,
the crystallographic binding poses are distinguished
not only because their ligands induce large stabilizing effects,
but also because they induce relatively low indirect destabilizations.
