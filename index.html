				  <p>At the atomic level, the molecules in our bodies are in constant motion, and undergoing constant change.  The motions are incredibly rich; they range from the isomerization of side-chains, to the formation and destruction of large intermolecular complexes, to the birth and death of the molecules themselves.
A deep understanding of these motions can radically improve our understanding of health and disease through rational design, where drugs target specific receptors chosen for a specific molecular impact.</p>
				  <p> The Dickson laboratory uses computational techniques such as molecular dynamics to simulate the motions of biomolecules (protein, RNA and DNA).  These numerical experiments extend our knowledge beyond the "snapshots" provided by X-ray crystallography and NMR, and provide the entire landscape of conformations accessible to a molecular system.  Our goal is to use this technique to gain a deep understanding of the binding of small molecule drugs, which will be used to design small molecule therapeutics.</p>
				  <p>We also use larger-scale network models of biological processes to gain understanding for processes that involve many different molecular species, such as chaperone action in the cell.  This allows a much broader reach, and can synthesize findings from simulation and experiment into a coherent biological model.  Working in both worlds simultaneously allows for a multiscale disease-targeting strategy that is detailed enough to capture atomic-level perturbations, and broad enough to capture the cell-level consequences of disease.</p>
